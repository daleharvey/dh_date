Format Dates In Erlang
----------------------

Changes by Gordon Guthrie added under the
Abbie Hoffman 'Steal This Book' License

This module formats erlang dates in the form
{{Year, Month, Day}, {Hour, Minute, Second}}
to printable strings, using (almost) equivalent
formatting rules as http://uk.php.net/date

erlang has no concept of timezone so the following
formats are not implemented: B e I O P T Z
formats c and r will also differ slightly

See unit tests in the source code for examples
